{slides}[Topic tonight]: Internet Protocol: Classless & Subnet Address Extensions (CIDR)

.problems to solve:
1. want to take large network & split into smaller pieces _(eg: routing of many
   geographically separated machines in a single class a network isn't inherently obvious)_
2. want to many small networks and blob them together

== 2: to tackle splitting large network

.one solution to (2): "proxy arp"
. internal routers see ARP requests based on *true* netid, and respond on behalf of actual
. known informally as "the ARP hack"
. easy on a napkin, gets ugly in complicated real networks
.. requires manual config, requires arp, can cause broadcast storms

.big picture addressing solution
|===
| netid | hostid
| prefix | suffix (huge)
| prefix | injection <1> | suffix (huge, but slightly smaller)
|===

_injection_ becomes a "subnet ID"

idea: all routers *internal* to a given netid are aware and route based on this
*subnetid*  

.better solution: subnetting
. QUESTION: doesn't this still require internal-routers to ARP proxy??

fixed length subnet mask vs variable-length subnet mask

.Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)
. more complex; tricky 
. addressing ambiguities

== 1: [next lecture]
