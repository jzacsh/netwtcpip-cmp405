{slides}[TCP continued] & more

if the tcp stream is over(ish) does requestor keep sending current next-byte ACK?

== routing: lecture 13

{routingslides}[routing slides]

IP implement routing

.routing 101
. hosts & routers *forward* datagrams
. ip forwarding is table-driven
. table called _routing table_ 

.static routing
 . fixed at boot time
 . useful for simple cases

.dynamic routing
. table initialized at boot time
. updated by protocols (propogating route info)
. necessary in large internets

.sources of info
. initialization (eg: from disk)
. updates (eg: from protocols)
. observations
.. *hosts tend to freeze* tables after initialization
.. routers use protocols to grow

=== dynamic routing algorithms

.classes of automatic route propogation
. distance-vector
. link-state

.distance-vector alg
. initialize table w/one entry for each direct-net
. periodically run distance-vector update to exchange info w/routers reachable
  over direct-nets eg:
.. broadcast your table contents w/distances (ie: directs are "0")
.. recv' such broadcast
   --> take min_subset against table (where max is on distance value)

NOTE: distance-vector does NOT broadcast route, only the (network,distance)
two-tuples

*eventually* stable
