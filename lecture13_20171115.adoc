continuiing {slides}[lecture chap 14] on BPB-4

NOTE: content of messages sent to an *AS* are in the *perspective* of the
receiving *AS*.

.possible internal metrics:
. hop count
. delays
. (economic) policies

NOTE: egp shares none of these metrics

== chapter 15

ONTO {slides15}[lecture for chapter 15]

.sample IGPs:
. RIP: link-state
. HELLO: distance vector
. OSPF: distance vector (by far one of most resilient)

.RIP
. originates from UNIX as `routed`
. uses hop-count metric
. distance-vector
. relies on broadcast
. LAN-intended: assumes low-delay
. split-horizon/poison reverse
. current standard: RIP2

general question about multicast: why not just another port?

.two forms of RIP:
. active
.. form *used by routers*
.. broadcasts routing updates periodicially
.. uses incoming messages to updates routes
. passive
.. form *used by hosts*
.. uses incoming messages to update routes
.. does not send updates

.RIP protocol details
. updates every 30 seconds
. 2-tuples of `(dest-address, distance)`
. `distance=16` -> unreachable/infinity
. `distance=1` -> direct _(not zero as in previous IGP we looked at)_ -- "zero-origin"

"slow convergence problem"...

solution to loop:
"split horizon"

Question: whiteboard sketch of routers {a,b,?} and their resolution for A's
disconnection from `w` -- seems there's a race on adapter `g` for router B




.measures of distances
. hops
.. zero-origin
.. one-origin (eg: RIP)
. delay
. throughput
. jitter(?)

.HELLO protocol: delay based
. NSFNET; kept delay between pairs of routers
. worked on NSFNET because network was simpler (equal throughput everywhere)

.OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
. link-state (recall: graph of network state is shared)
. more complicated to configure (eg: load-balancing options; subnetting by
"areas"; message-authentication; network-specific - ie: classless; etc.)


.ospf message types
1. hello (test reachability)
2. database (ie: topology)
3. link status request
4. link status update
5. link status acknowledgement

.modern IGPs in use
. RIP (distance vector)
. OSPF (link state)

== chapter 16: multi-casting

onto {slides16}[chapter 16 lecture]

.hardware multicasing
. NIC (network interface controller) accepts packets destined to
.. hardware unicast address
.. hardware broadcast address
. user can dynamically add/remove

.ethernet multicast
. per low-order bit of high-order byte
. eg: `01.00.00.00.00.00` base 16 (ie: `01`)

.IP multicast
. class D: `1110` (ie: 28 bits for groups)
. each multicast *group* assigned unique *class D*
. dynamic group membership: host can join/leave anytime
. use hardware multicase (where available); more efficient
. *same semantics* as UDP (and thus same semantics)
. *anyone* on network can be a sender
. two types
.. well-known (eg: rip2 is `224.0.0.9`)
.. transient groups

up to 224.0.0.255 used for multicast routing protocols
