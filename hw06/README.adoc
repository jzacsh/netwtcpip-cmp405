. stop accepting dest port/addr; instead build UI to take from user arbitrary
number of these (and maybe a default port) to correspond to an arbitrary number

                  Lehman College, City University of New York

This Homework Is Due By 11:59 PM on Monday October 30, 2017

For this assignment you will be extending what you learned about socket
programming in Datagram Socket Demo

You will be implementing a text messaging application. You will have a seperate
window for each person you are communicating with. The window will have as a
title the IP address and port number of the person you are messaging with.

You will have a main window that allows you to initiate messaging sessions with
other people based on their IP address and port number. Once you initiate a new
messaging session, you will create a new window for that session. This window
should also have a button to exit the program.

You will still have the receiving Thread which will handle all the incoming
messages. However, your code will also keep track of the source IP addresses
and port number along with the window containing that messaging session. If the
source IP address and port number combination is a new one, you will have to
open a new messaging window. Otherwise, the incoming message will be displayed
in the existing window for that source IP address.

Each window will have the following components:

 1. The title of the window should be the IP address and port number of the
    other side of the messaging session.
 2. A section to display the messaging interaction. This window should contain
    the messages from both you and the person you are messaging with.
 3. A section for you to type your reply.
 4. A button to send your reply.
 5. A button the close and end the messaging session.

Please submit your programs in a ZIP file containing all your java programs.

Please do not use packages for your project.
