continuiing {slides}[lecture chap 13] alternative to distance-vector algo: link-state

link-state algo is graph building, from the perspective of each node
. edges: networks
. vertices: routers/nodes

both: *Interior Gateway(router) Protocols* (IGPs)
. ie: both encoding the same thing, both propogating same thing in the same time
. tend to be used in limited/interior space

today's lecture, on {slides14}[chapter 14]: *Exterior Gateway Protocols* (EGP)

how to split up network into sub-networks? concept of *Autonomous Systems* (AS)

single *AS* equiv. *one administrative authority*
. internally to an AS: use IGP
. between to an AS: use EGP

.*BGP-4* ; most popular EGP: _"Border Gateway Protocol"_
. is classless-aware
. each *AS* has *one* representative, external-router
.. with allowance for fallbacks _(eg: multiple physically connected,
   but only one-at-a-time is elected)_
. does *not* propogate route distances/graphs/etc.
. only exposes *which* networks are available through the current *AS*
.. does *not* expose the details (eg: the distance-vectors for said network) 
. provides support for *policies* (ie: arbitrary economically-driven contracts)
. permits *incremental updates*
.. ie: no need to share *all* current info, can share delta
. allows *aggregation* of routes (ie: multiplexing routes through a single node)
. allows *authentication*
. uses *TCP* (most protocols use UDP)
.. sends *keepalive*
.. *four BGP message* types
... 1. OPEN - initialize communications
... 2. UPDATE - advertise/withdraw routes
... 3. NOTIFICATION - response to an incorrect message
... 4. KEEPALIVE - aggreed polling interval

see {rfcbgp4}["RFC 4271, BGP-4"] for actual details

BGP-4 compresses address entries by classful net; eg: `1,20` means "1 byte",
"20", for `20.0.0.0`
