= ip frame samples
:fall2017samples: http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfakhouri/teaching/cmp/cmp405/f17/examples/

files here are downloaded directly from {fall2017samples}[fall 2017 sample set],
and modified only in that the ip frames themselves were converted from their PDF
form (with fully colored diagrams, and questions, etc.) to an OCR `txt` file
dump of the datagram itself.
