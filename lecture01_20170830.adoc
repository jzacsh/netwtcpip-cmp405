== talking about hex

catchup/context for class...

.eg: converting to dec, from base 16 `CD` is:
|===
| C    | D
| 16   | 1
| 16^1 | 16^0
| (c * 16^1) | (D * 16^0)
| (12 * 16) | (13 * 1)
| 192 | 13
|===

`205 = 192 + 13`

takeaway: hex used as shorthand for 4-bit strings

== ip addresses

recall: ip's are 4-bytes

ip address division:
  address divided two parts: prefix (netid), suffix (hostid)


NOTE: tradeoffs in how to divide (bigger net, bigger host, same size both?)

solution was: *classful addressing*

.three classes
|===
| class | net | host | design
| a     | 1   | 3    | 0   -> net has 7 bits  (1 * 8 - 1)
| b     | 2   | 2    | 10  -> net has 14 bits (2 * 8 - 2)
| c     | 3   | 1    | 110 -> net has 21 bits (3 * 8 - 3)
|===

.size divisions:
1. 2^8  =~ 256
2. 2^16 =~ 16k
3. 2^24 =~ 2 Billion

"designator" column above: how to distinguish an address's class? need addr AND class-designation to be delivered?
solution: embed class IN address

.this classroom's machines have IP:
. ip: `148.84.129.*`
. netid: `148.84`
. host: `129.17`

.example practice: 148_10 = _2; how:
    128: 1, 64: 0, 32: 0, 16: 1, 8: 0, 4: 1, 2:0 , 1:0
    note: `10` is first two bytes, thus (see table above) *class B* network!


.`2^7: 128` nets is ACTUALLY `126`; `0` reserved, `127` reserved
|===
| reservation | in bits | reason
| zero | 0 000 000 | dhcp: client's addresses (sent over broadcast)
| 127  | 1 111 111 | broadcast
|===

.pool sizes
|===
| class | net | host | design
| a     | 1  ->  2^7-2=126 | 2^24-2=~16Bill
| b     | 2  -> 2^14-2=~16k | 2^16-2=~65k
| c     | 3  -> 2^21-2=~2Bill | 2^7-2=126
|===

so "classful" because ip address *itself* indicates its class

NOTE: these are the *unicast* classes

Class "D" is for *multicast*
(ie: subscriptions)

first bits are: `1110`

Class "E" not being used (`11110`; reserved)


=== practice examples

==== class B: `8C3B2EF1`

given `8C3B2EF1` what class is this address?
convert to decimal: `1000 1100  0011 1011`

.steps:
1. take *first byte* `8C`
2. inspect: `1000 1100`
3. first bits: `10`
4. thus *class b*
5. then NETID: `1000 1100` (`8C3B`) = `140`
6. then HOSTID: `0011 1011` (`2EF1`) = `59.46.241`
7.

.per-byte conversion
. `8` `C` <- `1000` `1100` +
            128 + 8 + 4 = 140
. `3` `B` <- `0011` `1011` +
            32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 59
. `2` `E` <- `0010` `1110` +
            32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 46
. `F` `1` <- `1111` `0001` +
            240  + 1 = 241
. therefore: `140.59.46.241`

==== class A: `462C7B2E`

.`46` = `0100`
. -> *class a*
. -> netid is only *one* byte
. -> netid = `46`
. -> hostid = `2C7B2E`

.per-byte conversion
. `4` `6` <- `?` `?` +
        ?? = 70
. `2` `C` <- `0010` `1100` +
        32 + 8 + 4 = 44
. `7B` <- `0111` `1011` +
        ?? = 123
. `2E` <- `0010` `1110` +
        ?? = 46
. therefore: `70.44.123.46`

TODO: memorize hex -> binary conversions


==== class c: `C1F72B3F`

`1100` `0001`
. `110` first bits
. -> *class c*
. -> netid: `C1F72B`
. -> hostid: `3F`

. `C1` <- ?? +
       = 193

193.247.43.63


=== addressing cont'd

*limited broadcast*:
    "local" or "limited" broadcast to all on *my* netid

*directed broadcast*:
    broadcast to *other* netid; ie: send `netid:FFF...`

*multi-homed host*:
    eg: multiple netcards, or (eg: a phone) manipulating multiple tranc'vrs [bluetooth, wifi, lte]



loopback address (reserved) `127.*` actually goes through network device (but loops back); tests really working
