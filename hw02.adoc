.numerical questions
|===
| no. | question | answer

| 1  | Find the source hardware address. |
  `B9 AA B8 AO OF C3`
| 2  | Find the destination hardware address. |
  `C4 BC 6E 3A 5C E7`
| 3  | What type of frame is this? |
  `08 00`
| 4  | What *fragment* Flag(s) are set? |
  `011`
| 5  | What is the fragment offset? |
  `6145` = `1 1000 0000 0001`
| 6  | What is the TTL count? |
  `0x83` = `131`
| 7  | What is the Header Checksum? |
  `EB 40`
| 8  | If the header includes no options or padding, what are the first five
bytes of the datagram data? |
  `41 8E B7 C2 CB`
| 9  | Find the destination IP address. |
  `B3 DC 88 4D`
| 10 |  What class is the destination IP address? |
  Class B; `B` = `1011` -> net: `B3 DC` ^ host: `88 4D`
| 11 |  What is the network ID in the destination address? |
  `B3 DC` (see #10)
| 12 |  What is the host ID in the destination address? |
  `88 4D` (see #10)
| 13 |  Write the destination IP address in dotted decimal notation. |
  `179.220.136.77`
| 14 |  Find the source IP address. |
  `CC 51 2D BB`
| 15 |  What class is the source IP address? |
  Class C; `C` = `1100` -> netid: `CC 51 2D` ^ host: `BB`
| 16 |  What is the network ID in the source address? |
  `CC 51 2D` (see #15)
| 17 |  What is the host ID in the source address? |
  `BB` (see #15)
| 18 |  Write the source IP address in dotted decimal notation. |
  `204.81.45.187`
| 19 |  Can this message be delivered directly by the source to the destination,
or will it require routers to handle the message. |
  Will require routers, as they're on different netids (`CC 51 2D` != `B3 DC`).

== hw #2 scratch work


WARNING: below was with a ton of misunderstanding. above section are my answers,
but the work is on paper.

scratch work done for hw #2 while waiting for lecture to start
